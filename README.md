# PushChain Examples

A comprehensive collection of example applications, SDK functions, and smart contracts to help you build on PushChain. This repository serves as a learning resource and reference implementation for developers looking to leverage PushChain's cross-chain capabilities.

## Repository Structure

### [Apps](./apps)

Complete application examples showcasing various PushChain features and integration patterns. Each app demonstrates a specific use case or implementation approach.

#### Available Applications

- **[Simulate](./apps/simulate)** - A transaction simulation tool that helps developers test and validate cross-chain transactions before executing them on mainnet. Includes transaction preview and gas estimation features.

### [Core SDK Functions](./core-sdk-functions)

Examples of how to use PushChain's SDK for common blockchain operations, including account management, transaction handling, cross-chain communication, and more.

#### Available SDK Examples

- **[Create Universal Signer](./core-sdk-functions/create-universal-signer)** - Learn how to create and manage universal signers that work across multiple blockchains.

- **[Custom Universal Signer](./core-sdk-functions/custom-universal-signer)** - Advanced examples of customizing universal signer behavior for specific use cases.

- **[Initialize EVM Client](./core-sdk-functions/initialize-evm-client)** - Examples of connecting to and interacting with EVM-compatible blockchains.

- **[Initialize Push Chain Client](./core-sdk-functions/initialize-push-chain-client)** - Learn how to initialize and configure the PushChain client for your applications.

- **[Reading Push Chain State](./core-sdk-functions/reading-push-chain-state)** - Examples of reading and querying state from the PushChain network.

- **[Send Universal Transaction](./core-sdk-functions/send-universal-transaction)** - Learn how to send transactions that work across multiple blockchains using PushChain's universal transaction system.

- **[Speedrun](./core-sdk-functions/speedrun)** - Quick start examples for rapid development and testing.

- **[Utility Functions](./core-sdk-functions/utility-functions)** - Common utility functions and helper methods for PushChain development.

- **[Others Contract Helpers](./core-sdk-functions/others-contract-helpers)** - Additional contract interaction helpers and utilities.

### [Tutorials](./tutorials)

Step-by-step guides and example projects that teach you how to build specific features using PushChain. Each tutorial includes both smart contracts and frontend code.

#### Available Tutorials

- **[Universal Counter](./tutorials/universal-counter)** - A demonstration of cross-chain interaction using PushChain's Universal Ethereum Account (UEA) system. This project shows how users from Ethereum, Solana, and PushChain can interact with the same application seamlessly.
